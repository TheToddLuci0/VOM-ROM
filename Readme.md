# VOM-ROM
Turns your Defcon32 badge in to a rainbow vomit nightmare.


## Compiling
Requires GBDK. Throw this into the examples folder and compile. Alternatively, 
do what I was too lazy to and fix the makefile to not depend on a hardcoded
relative path. Up to you :)


## Origianl readme
An minimal template project with a Makefile that only compiles files in the same directory

The Makefile will automatically detect and compile new source files as long 
as they are placed in the same directory as the Makefile
